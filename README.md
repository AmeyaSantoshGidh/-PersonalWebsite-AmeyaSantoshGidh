1) Index.html is my landing page. It is the top page, defined in index.html, which your viewers will land on. It allows people know what the site is about and contains the necessary links and navigation for people to get around the site.
2) My site has a footer and navigation element at the top where the user can move through the site with easy.There are no dead ends, and the user can move back and forth using the navigation element at the top. Navigational elements do not scroll out of sight or disappear when the window is resized. Color and positioning of the navigational elements is styled in CSS.

3) Two or more internal links. These should link to separate pages within my site. For example, a personal page might has links to a "Resume", "Contact Me","Projects","Work experience","Hobbies". A company website might have a link to a "Who We Are" page and a "Products and Services" page. The styling of the internal links should match the styling of the rest of the site, and the navigational elements should be present. Internal links should open their content in the same browser tab as the site is being viewed in. The assignment links on our course web page are examples of this.
